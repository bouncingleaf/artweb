        <h1>Don't let overwhelm and helplessness win</h1>
        <h2>What to do?</h2>
        <p>
            People are at a loss about what to do. It seems so bleak as we watch the Trump administration and their friends tearing democracy apart, people's health and safety in jeopardy, international relations being trampled, and a bunch of rich bros playing games with people's lives and livelihoods. It's nauseating.
        </p>
        <p>
            But: overwhelm and hopelessness is part of the plan. It's essential to the plan.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we believe that...
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>there's nothing we can do,</li>
            <li>anything we try won't help, </li>
            <li>nobody else is doing anything,</li>
            <li>they are unstoppable,</li>
            <li>we don't know what to do,</li>
            <li>we don't have any energy to do anything...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>... all of these beliefs will keep us from acting. And the one thing they don't want us to do is act. People staying quiet and compliant is essential for making the democracy fall.
        </p>

        <h2>Reminders</h2>
        <p>Things I'm reminding myself:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Choose your battles.</b> Getting worked up about every new offense will wear you out fast. Ignore the noise, focus on what does real harm.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Limit news.</b> Take in news only to the extent that it helps you. Doomscrolling can feel like "doing something." It isn't.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>We aren't powerless.</b> There ARE things people can do. There ARE people taking action.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Consider your strengths.</b> How can you be most effective? What do you have access to, what skills do you have, what resources do you have? (Hint: One of my skills is publishing a website, another is assembling information from disparate sources...)
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Share what's good.</b> We need hope, joy, community, art, rest, nourishment, laughter, support... Let's take care of ourselves and each other.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Nobody elected Elon.</b> Don't assume that everything he does is legitimate and must be obeyed. Actually that should apply even to the elected ones at this point. Social media posts are not law. Just because Trump said it, or one of his henchmen said it, doesn't make it real, legal, or binding.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Resources</h2>

                The CIA's intention was that tactics like these could be used to gum up the works as an act of resistance. But you might recognize some of the practices in this document as commonplace in a typical American work environment.
                Now imagine if you worked in an organization and you have been asked to do something harmful, unethical, immoral... maybe you're afraid of repercussions if you outright refuse. There might be other ways to resist.

            <p>Below, just a few notable events from the first few weeks of Term 2.</p>

            <h3>
                February 4 update
            </h3>
            USAID and more
            <ul>
                <li>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had taken over as acting head of USAID, the government’s international aid agency, hours after Elon Musk said the White House was closing it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Musk railed against the agency on social media, calling it a “criminal organization” without offering evidence. “Time for it to die,” he wrote.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rubio said many of the agency’s programs — which include health services and disaster relief — were worthwhile. But he said its work needed to align more closely with U.S. foreign policy goals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Trump froze billions in international aid. The decision is already <Link to="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/world/asia/trump-usaid-freeze.html">worsening humanitarian crises</Link>, including one in Sudan, where soup kitchens that serve nearly a million people have shut down.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Pentagon is <Link to="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/business/media/pentagon-press-corps.html">removing dedicated office space</Link> from four major news organizations, including The New York Times and NPR, to make room for right-wing outlets like Breitbart News and One America News.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The C.D.C. ordered its <Link to="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cdc-orders-papers-withdrawn-forbidden-words_n_67a02486e4b0521901454fe9">scientists to withdraw any pending publications</Link> that mention terms such as “transgender,” “immigrant” or “L.G.B.T.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Trump administration <Link to="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/politics/trump-venezuela-temporary-protected-status.html">revoked Temporary Protected Status for more than 300,000 Venezuelans</Link> in the U.S. The move puts them at risk of deportation in coming months.
                </li>
                <li>The ability of a spoiled rich boy to destroy our country is truly reaching unparalleled heights in 2025:
                    <blockquote>
                        The Department of Government Efficiency, run by President Donald Trump’s billionaire adviser and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, has gained access to sensitive Treasury data including Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems, according to two people familiar with the situation.

                        The move by DOGE, a Trump administration task force assigned to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations, means it could have wide leeway to access important taxpayer data, among other things.
                    </blockquote>

            <h3>
                Some of the more scary stuff from OMG IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN TWO WEEKS
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Justice Department fired more than a dozen prosecutors at the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington who had been hired to investigate the Jan. 6 riot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There's an anti-vaxxer as the nominee to lead Health and Human Services. Sounds like a recipe for countless people not surviving the next pandemic. Here's hoping he doesn't get confirmed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>He's removing security details from former government officials.</b> - It's chilling not just for the people affected, but also for people who are in comparable positions now. If doing your job gets you death threats, the protection of the government may run out for you if the guy in charge decides you aren't cool anymore.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <Link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_dismissals_of_inspectors_general">2025 dismissals of inspectors general</Link> (Wikipedia) -
                    "Inspectors general (IGs) serve as independent watchdogs within federal agencies, tasked with investigating allegations of fraud, waste, and abuse. Their roles are to maintain transparency and accountability within government operations. These officials are appointed to serve across different administrations and are protected under federal law, which requires the president to provide a 30-day notice to Congress before any dismissal."
                    Any notice provided? Of course not. Republican Senator Susan Collins stated, "I don't understand why one would fire individuals whose mission it is to root out waste, fraud and abuse." Nah, we all understand why someone would do that.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>That Nazi salute at the inauguration? Not an accident.</b>
                    Musk (and Trump) may or may not <Link to="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/31/is-elon-musk-a-nazi-and-can-he-get-european-far-right-hardliners-elected">BE a Nazi,</Link> per se. From this article:
                    "Is Elon Musk a Nazi? Nazis seem to think so. Christian nationalists, white supremacists and avowed neo-Nazis in the US all hailed Musk’s salute as a historic comeback for their cause." and "'No, he is not [a Nazi],' said Jean-Yves Camus, co-director of the Observatory of Political Radicalism at the Jean Jaures Foundation in Paris. He believes Musk and Trump are self-serving rather than ideological."
                    and "'I believe he is ideologically unmoored,' agreed Constantinos Filis, who directs the Institute of Global Affairs at the American College of Greece."

            <h3>Wow.</h3>
            <p>
                Day four or so and I just gave up trying to stay on top of this list. Gotta admit the guy's getting a lot done. A lot of damage.

            </p>
            <p>
                I added a list of news links at the top of this page. Remember that keeping informed should serve a good purpose. Being motivated to act is a good purpose. Being stressed out to the point where you are too overwhelmed to act is not.

            Welcome to term 2. You Know Who issued a bunch of executive orders - <Link to="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-executive-orders-list.html">Trump’s Executive Orders: Reversing Biden’s Policies and Attacking the ‘Deep State’</Link> (NY Times). Here are some of the orders he signed on his first day in office:

            <h4>Federal Work Force</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Freeze federal hiring, except for members of the military or “positions related to immigration enforcement, national security, or public safety.”</li>
                <li>Restore a category of federal workers known as Schedule F, which would lack the same job protections enjoyed by career civil servants.</li>
                <li>Halt new federal rules from going into effect before Trump administration appointees can review them.</li>
                <li>Review the investigative actions of the Biden administration, “to correct past misconduct by the federal government related to the weaponization of law enforcement and the weaponization of the intelligence community.”</li>
                <li>Grant top secret security clearances to White House staff without going through traditional vetting procedures.</li>
                <li>End remote work policies and order federal workers back to the office full time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
                Immigration and the Border
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Bar asylum for people newly arriving at the southern border.</li>
                <li>Move to end birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, for the children of undocumented immigrants. The president cannot change the Constitution on his own, so it is not yet clear how Mr. Trump plans to withhold the benefits of citizenship to a group of people born in the United States. Any move is all but certain to be challenged in court.</li>
                <li>Suspend the Refugee Admissions Program “until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States.”</li>
                <li>Declare migrant crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border to be a national emergency, allowing Mr. Trump to unilaterally unlock federal funding for border wall construction, without approval from Congress, for stricter enforcement efforts.</li>
                <li>Resume a policy requiring people seeking asylum to wait in Mexico while an immigration judge considers their cases.</li>
                <li>Consider designating cartels as “foreign terrorist organizations.” </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
                Gender and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Initiatives
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Terminate D.E.I. programs across the federal government.</li>
                <li>Recognize two sexes: male and female.</li>
                <li>Remove protections for transgender people in federal prisons.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
                Tariffs and Trade
            </h4>
